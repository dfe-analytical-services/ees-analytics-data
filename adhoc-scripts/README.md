# Explore education statistics analytics - ad hoc scripts

Collection of one-off scripts that might have useful code for future analysts on the project (including future you).

Access requirements will vary by script, and there's no guarantees old scripts will still work.

There is a folder adhoc-scripts/adhoc-data/, that is ignored by Git, so write any ad hoc data sets into the there to avoid committing.
